# SnapCast Docker Container
This is a container for the audiostation project. Documentation here might be wrong.

 [SnapCast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) are a wonderful Multiroom Audio solution. This Repository only contains the SnapCast part, for a full Home Entertaiment System you need additional software like [Mopidy](https://www.mopidy.com/). A full compose file can be found under [nolte/docker_compose-audiostation](https://github.com/nolte/docker_compose-audiostation).

## Containers

### Android

 Use the original Andorid Client from [badaix/snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/releases/latest) !
